A python library for jumbling letters within words. For background information, see section "Background" at the bottom of this page.

# Background

## Hypothesis

It doesn't matter in what order the letters in a word are, the only important thing is that the first and last letter be at the right place. The rest can be a total mess and you can still read it without problem. This is because the human mind does not read every letter by itself, but the word as a whole.

## Example

The jumbling of the words of the hypothesis stated above might end up in the following result:

"It doesn't matetr in what order the letrets in a word are, the only imonarptt thing is that the first and last letetr be at the right place. The rest can be a total mess and you can still read it wihuott prbelom. This is beasuce the human mind does not read every letetr by itslef, but the word as a whole."
